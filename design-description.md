# EasyPass DMV Practice Tracker – Design Document

## Project Description

EasyPass DMV Practice Tracker is a full-stack web application designed to help users prepare for DMV written tests more effectively. Unlike traditional practice apps, EasyPass focuses on tracking user mistakes, reviewing weak areas, and improving long-term retention.

The system provides features such as:

- Browsing and filtering questions
- Taking quizzes and checking answers
- Saving important questions
- Reviewing mistake history
- Tracking progress over time

The frontend is built using React with hooks and client-side rendering (CSR), while the backend uses Node.js with Express and a MongoDB database (native driver).
